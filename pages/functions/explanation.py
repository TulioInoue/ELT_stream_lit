        <h4>Consequences of High and Low Concentrations of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in Cities</h4>
        <h5>High CO Concentrations</h5>
        <p>
            High levels of carbon monoxide in urban areas primarily stem from vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and inefficient combustion of fossil fuels. The consequences include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Health Risks</b>: CO binds with hemoglobin in the blood, reducing oxygen transport, leading to headaches, dizziness, confusion, and, in extreme cases, death. Chronic exposure can cause cardiovascular and neurological issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Air Quality Degradation</b>: High CO levels contribute to smog formation, reducing visibility and exacerbating respiratory conditions.  
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Increased Greenhouse Gas Effects</b>: While CO itself is not a direct greenhouse gas, it influences the concentration of methane and ozone, contributing indirectly to climate change.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Impact on Urban Ecosystems</b>: Elevated CO levels can affect plant health and disrupt local ecosystems by reducing oxygen availability in certain environments.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Low CO Concentrations</h5>
        <p>             
            Low CO levels in cities generally indicate better air quality and improved public health. The benefits include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Reduced Health Risks</b>: Lower exposure to CO means fewer respiratory and cardiovascular issues among city residents.</li>
            <li><b>Improved Air Quality</b>: Cities with low CO levels often have cleaner air, benefiting both humans and the environment.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Urban Livability</b>: Reduced pollution leads to better quality of life, increased outdoor activity, and economic benefits such as lower healthcare costs.</li>
            <li><b>Sustainable Urban Development</b>: Low CO concentrations often result from effective policies like emission controls, green transportation, and renewable energy adoption.</li>

        <h4>Consequences of High and Low Concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) in Cities</h4>
        <h5>High NO₂ Concentrations</h5>
        <p>
            High levels of nitrogen dioxide in urban areas primarily come from vehicle emissions, power plants, and industrial activities. The consequences include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Severe Health Effects</b>: NO₂ is a major respiratory irritant, causing inflammation of the airways, aggravating asthma, and increasing the risk of lung infections and cardiovascular diseases. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic lung conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Poor Air Quality and Smog Formation</b>: NO₂ contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), worsening air pollution and visibility.</li>
            <li><b>Acid Rain and Environmental Damage</b>: NO₂ reacts with water in the atmosphere, forming nitric acid, which leads to acid rain. This damages buildings, soils, and aquatic ecosystems.</li>
            <li><b>Contribution to Climate Change</b>: While NO₂ itself is not a greenhouse gas, it plays a role in ozone formation, which contributes to global warming.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Low NO₂ Concentrations</h5>
        <p>
            Lower NO₂ levels in cities are typically the result of strict emission controls and cleaner transportation options. The benefits include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Better Public Health</b>: Fewer respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses result from cleaner air, reducing hospital visits and healthcare costs.</li>
            <li><b>Improved Air Quality</b>: Lower NO₂ levels mean less smog and particulate matter, enhancing visibility and making cities more livable.</li>
            <li><b>Protection of Ecosystems</b>: Reduced NO₂ levels decrease the risk of acid rain, preserving forests, soil quality, and aquatic life.</li>
            <li><b>Sustainable Urban Development</b>: Low NO₂ concentrations indicate effective environmental policies, cleaner energy sources, and the successful adoption of green technologies.</li>

    <h4>Consequences of High and Low Concentrations of Ozone (O₃) in Cities</h4>
    <h5>High O₃ Concentrations</h5>
    <p>
        Ground-level ozone (tropospheric ozone) forms when pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight. High ozone levels in cities lead to several negative consequences:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Severe Health Effects</b>: O₃ is a strong respiratory irritant, causing coughing, throat irritation, shortness of breath, and worsening asthma and lung diseases. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic respiratory issues.</li>
        <li><b>Poor Air Quality and Smog Formation</b>: High O₃ contributes to photochemical smog, reducing visibility and making outdoor conditions hazardous, especially for vulnerable populations.</li>
        <li><b>Damage to Vegetation and Ecosystems</b>: O₃ exposure weakens plants, reducing agricultural yields and harming forests and natural ecosystems by interfering with photosynthesis.</li>
        <li><b>Material Degradation</b>: Ozone accelerates the breakdown of materials like rubber, plastics, and paint, increasing maintenance costs for infrastructure and vehicles.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Low O₃ Concentrations</h5>
    <p>
        Unlike some pollutants, ground-level ozone is harmful in excess but does not need to be entirely eliminated. However, lower concentrations lead to several benefits:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Improved Public Health</b>: Reduced ozone levels mean fewer respiratory diseases, lower hospital admissions, and a healthier population.</li>
        <li><b>Better Air Quality and Visibility</b>: Low O₃ levels prevent the formation of dense smog, making urban environments more livable.</li>
        <li><b>Healthier Ecosystems</b>: Reduced ozone exposure helps plants and crops grow properly, improving food security and biodiversity.</li>
        <li><b>Lower Infrastructure Damage</b>: Less ozone exposure extends the lifespan of buildings, vehicles, and other materials, reducing maintenance costs.</li>

    <h4>Consequences of High and Low Concentrations of Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) in Cities</h4>
    <h5>High SO₂ Concentrations</h5>
    <p>
        Sulfur dioxide primarily originates from burning fossil fuels (especially coal and oil), industrial processes, and vehicle emissions. High SO₂ levels in urban areas lead to several negative consequences:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Severe Health Effects</b>: SO₂ is a major respiratory irritant, causing coughing, throat irritation, shortness of breath, and aggravating asthma and chronic lung diseases. Prolonged exposure increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</li>
        <li><b>Formation of Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)</b>: SO₂ reacts in the atmosphere to form sulfate particles, a major component of PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems.</li>
        <li><b>Acid Rain and Environmental Damage</b>: SO₂ combines with water vapor to form sulfuric acid, leading to acid rain, which damages soil, aquatic ecosystems, forests, and buildings.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced Air Quality and Visibility</b>: High SO₂ levels contribute to haze and smog, lowering visibility and making urban environments less livable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Low SO₂ Concentrations</h4>
    <p>
        Lower SO₂ levels in cities are often achieved through strict emission regulations, cleaner energy sources, and improved industrial processes. The benefits include:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Better Public Health</b>: Reduced SO₂ levels lead to fewer respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, decreasing hospitalizations and healthcare costs.</li>
        <li><b>Improved Air Quality</b>: Less SO₂ means lower PM2.5 formation and clearer skies, improving urban livability.</li>
        <li><b>Protection of Ecosystems</b>: Lower SO₂ concentrations reduce the risk of acid rain, preserving soil fertility, water quality, and biodiversity.</li>
        <li><b>Sustainable Urban Development</b>: Low SO₂ levels indicate successful air pollution control measures, such as the adoption of renewable energy and emission-reduction technologies.</li>
